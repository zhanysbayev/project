1)My database contains two tables:order and products.
And they are connected between with column product_id. Because both of them contain this column and order can not be created without product. And so to define product. I used product id as primary key to the table products and as foreign key to the table orders.
2)In this picture below, you can erd diagram for those tables.
3)My website supports three languages as English,Russian and Kazakh languages.And has buttons two switch languages on the main page(home) and on the second page(about).When we are going throw the pages.Whole website will be in Language that we choosed in the begining.
4)On the second page where i have several cards. I have button (buy). When you press it, you will go to the another page (create/order) and here you can upload file or photo.
5)On the end of the page i have footer. And here i have several links that work on the website.And when you press to the link (email).Another window will open and i receive email message.
